description: If you live abroad, we can assist you with our interior design services also online, without meeting in person and without supervision of construction, with videoconsulations.

If you live abroad and you are open to consult and keep in touch online, our packages, Basic, Standard, Optimum and Premium can also be requested to be delivered online.

In this case you will need to provide us the architectural plan of your home from which we will work as we will not be able to go for site assessment or personal consultation. 

We need photographs of the building from inside and outside from various angles and also a virtual tour of your home. 

Online we will discuss what your needs and expectations are, you will receive the plans in digital format, no worries all the details can be clarified during our consultations. 

Prices we set after our discussion for the packages in virtual form, and you can pay in either USD or EUR.
