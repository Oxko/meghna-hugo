If you live abroad or would just prefer us to deliver our home furnishing services without face-to-face meetings, we can also fulfill your requests online with continuous online consultations.

With the exception of parts that require face-to-face meetings, such as supervision, if you are open to keep in touch online, planning can work more flexibly and conveniently for you, we can even go shopping together, too.

In this case you will need to provide us the architectural plan of your home from which we will work as we will not be able to go for site assessment or personal consultation. 

We need photographs of the building from inside and outside from various angles and also a virtual tour of your home. 

Online we will discuss what your needs and expectations are, you will receive the plans in digital format, no worries all the details can be clarified during our consultations. 

Prices we set after our discussion for the packages in virtual form, and you can pay in either USD or EUR.
